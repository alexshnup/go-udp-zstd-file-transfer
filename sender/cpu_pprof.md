The profiling output for the sender shows that a significant portion of the time is spent on system-level operations. Here's a breakdown of the top entries:

- runtime.kevent: High time in kevent indicates that the application is heavily involved in waiting for or processing kernel events. This is common in I/O-heavy applications, such as network services or file handling processes.

- runtime.madvise: This syscall advises the kernel about how to handle paging for a given range of memory. Significant time here suggests the application is managing memory actively, which could be related to memory-mapped files or other direct memory management strategies.

- runtime.pthread_kill: Time here indicates that threads are being interrupted often. This might be a part of your application's logic or a symptom of some underlying issue that requires threads to be killed prematurely.

- runtime.pthread_cond_wait: This call, along with pthread_cond_signal, is a part of thread synchronization primitives. It's normal to see some time spent here, but excessive waiting could indicate contention or inefficiency in thread/goroutine coordination.

- runtime.memclrNoHeapPointers: This is an internal Go runtime function that clears memory. Time spent here suggests that the application is allocating and possibly deallocating large amounts of memory.

- syscall.syscall6: Time in system calls indicates interaction with the operating system, such as file operations, network calls, or other kernel-level interactions.

- runtime.pthread_cond_signal: This is used to wake up threads waiting on a condition variable. It works hand in hand with pthread_cond_wait.

- runtime.scanobject: This is a garbage collection-related operation. Time spent here suggests that garbage collection is actively scanning objects, which could mean there's substantial heap allocation happening.

- runtime.writeHeapBits.flush: This is related to garbage collection and memory management. It may indicate frequent allocations or garbage collection activity.

- runtime.pthread_cond_timedwait_relative_np: Indicates waiting on a condition with a timeout, similar to pthread_cond_wait.

From this profile, the sender seems to be engaged in heavy synchronization and memory management. This could mean that your application's performance is being affected by how it's handling concurrency and memory. There might be room for optimization in the way threads are synchronized and how memory is being allocated and managed.

Here are some steps you can take to optimize further:

Review Thread Synchronization: The high amount of time spent in pthread_cond_wait and pthread_cond_signal indicates that threads are often waiting for work or synchronization with other threads. Review your synchronization strategy to ensure it is efficient.

Optimize Memory Usage: With time spent in memclrNoHeapPointers and madvise, you might be able to optimize how memory is used and allocated. Re-using buffers, reducing allocations, and ensuring that the garbage collector is not overwhelmed can help.

Improve Garbage Collection: Since scanobject and writeHeapBits.flush are indicating notable garbage collection work, you can consider reducing allocation rates or tuning the garbage collector with GOGC environment variable.

Concurrency Model: Consider if the current concurrency model is efficient. Analyze if goroutines are managed effectively, and whether the work can be batched or structured differently to reduce contention.

When dealing with I/O, always look for ways to reduce the number of system calls (batching writes/reads, using buffers effectively, etc.) and consider using non-blocking I/O or I/O multiplexing if that’s not already the case.

Finally, it might be helpful to correlate these findings with actual code paths using the list command in pprof to see exactly where in your code these bottlenecks occur.
